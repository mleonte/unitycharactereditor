# Unity Character Editor

Requires these packages out of the box:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/polygon-modular-fantasy-hero-characters-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-143468

Can be easily modified to remove the second dependency.


TODO:

- Remove reliance on Odin
- Fix material handling
